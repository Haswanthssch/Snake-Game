# Snake Game

This is my first project with Python Turtle Graphics: a snake game.

Use the following keys to control the snake:
- **W**: Up
- **S**: Down
- **A**: Left
- **D**: Right
- The Snake size increases when it consumes the food. THe food gets another coordinate immediately after the snake consumption.
- The game ends only when the snake hits any of the walls.
